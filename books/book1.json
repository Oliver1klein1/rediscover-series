  "subtitle": "",
  "description": "You've been worshiping the wrong God!\n\nJesus exposed Him. Paul enshrined Him.\n\nYahweh is not the Father!\n\nThis book is a wrecking ball.\n\nWith scripture as evidence, it unmasks Yahweh's commands — genocide, slavery, child sacrifice — and the shocking truth that Paul, not Jesus, built Christianity.\n\nOur Father's identity has been distorted. As has ours. We'd been neutralized. Mission-accomplished. Potential-stifled.\n\nThis book splits the cracks wide open: no blood sacrifice required, no \"original sin,\" no counterfeit god. Only the Father Jesus revealed … pure love without terms and conditions. United with us.\n\nRaw. Explosive. Liberating.",
