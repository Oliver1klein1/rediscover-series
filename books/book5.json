  "description": "Some of what you know of Jesus is a fabrication. Not the man himself, but the story we've been told about him. For centuries, the church has systematically reframed Jesus' radical message, turning a revolutionary teacher of love and liberation into a religious figurehead who supports the very systems he came to dismantle. This book peels back the layers of theological manipulation to reveal the authentic Jesus the one who challenged religious authority, championed the marginalized, and taught that the kingdom of God is within you, not in a distant heaven. Discover how parts of his identity were touched up for over 2000 years and why it matters.",
