  "description": "What if the Bible's contradictions are clues, not merely errors? 101 Illustrated Bible Contradictions exposes the hidden seams: verses that clash, timelines that twist, doctrines that collide. But beneath the chaos lies some deeper truths. These cracks reveal two competing images of God: the wrathful Yahweh of Moses versus the loving Father Jesus revealed. And a divided faith, torn between Jesus' Kingdom of Love and Paul's empire-friendly gospel. In this eye-opening guide, 12 Keys unlock what the contradictions show us: how Scripture was shaped, edited, and weaponized… and how the Truth still shines through. See the flaws. Find the freedom. Rediscover the Father.",
