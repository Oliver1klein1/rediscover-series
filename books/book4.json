Where quantum physics, near-death experiences, and ancient wisdom converge to expose the truth: consciousness, not matter, is the foundation of existence. Discover how Jesus' hidden sayings align with cutting-edge science to reveal that \"the kingdom of God is within you.\" You are not a helpless sinner awaiting rescue. You are a divine co-creator in a conscious universe, capable of manifesting healing, abundance, and transformation through awakened awareness. If you've begun questioning the old stories and are ready to uncover the breathtaking truth of who you really are, turn the page … and awaken to the universe Jesus knew all along.",
