      "description": "What if the story of eternal torment isn't from Jesus at all?\n\nIn Escape the Hell Myth, Ansilo Boff exposes the shocking truth: the doctrine of everlasting punishment was built on mistranslations, theological bias, and fear-based control ... not on the words of Jesus.\n\nThrough deep linguistic study and bold spiritual insight, this book unpacks what \"Sheol\", \"Hades\", \"Gehenna\", and \"aionios\" really meant in the original texts, how Jesus' teachings reveal a God of restoration, not retribution, why Yahweh's violent commands contradict the loving Father Jesus revealed, and the breathtaking hope of universal reconciliation: a divine plan to heal all creation.\n\nIf you've ever questioned how a loving God could condemn souls to eternal fire, this book will help you escape the lie and rediscover the liberating message of Jesus. Jesus never taught Hell. He revealed a Father who restores, not destroys.",
