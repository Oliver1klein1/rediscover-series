            <p>For two thousand years, religion has distorted Jesus' message … turning liberation into obedience, and love into fear. It told us God demanded blood, that sin defined us from birth, and that submission (being 'under authority') mattered more than awareness.</p>
            
            <p>But what if that story wasn't from Jesus at all?</p>
            
            <p>This series rips through the edits, lies, and power plays that buried his true teachings. It exposes how Yahweh's wrath was mistaken for the Father's love … and how Paul's control replaced Jesus' freedom. From Liberating Humanity to Escape the Hell Myth, these books uncover a single revelation: Jesus never preached fear, wrath, or blood sacrifice. The scriptures were tampered with. Jesus revealed a Father who restores, not destroys.</p>
            
            <p>From fear to freedom. From illusion to truth.</p>
            
            <p><em>Raw. Daring. Restorative.</em></p>
            
            <p>This isn't the end of faith … it's the beginning of awakening and living abundantly.</p>
            
            <p>All available in 6 x 9 inch paperback, hardcover and ebook format. Audiobook available for "Liberating Humanity: How Jesus Exposed The Evil God Of Moses And Warned Of Paul"</p>
